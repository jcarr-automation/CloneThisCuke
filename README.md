# CloneThisCuke

General-Purpose **Maven** project that was created using **Java 13**, leveraging the common **Cucumber**, **Selenium Webdriver** and **RestAssured** test frameworks.
 
This project is meant to be a "jumpstart" BDD/ATDD project for any test automation engagements that would need scripts for:
- Web Browser
- REST API
- Native Windows, Mac
- SQL

There are drivers in the project that enable each of the above interfaces to be tested.

*Drivers yet to be implemented or tested:*
- Web Browser (Mac OS X, Linux, SauceLabs)
- Native Windows, Mac
- Native Mobile
- SQL (MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle, Sybase, DB2)

## Installation

There are a couple options...

### Using IDE directly to import from GitHub

_This is the way._

I'm assuming a lot here, mostly that you have your favorite code editor set up, and it has a functioning integration with GitHub (maybe via git plugins).
I'm also assuming you have a web browser open to GitHub, specifically this repo: https://github.com/jcarr-automation/CloneThisCuke

#### Eclipse (or other variants. I use Spring Tool Suite, for example)

1. File > Import... > Git > Projects from Git (click Next)
2. Select 'Clone URI' (click Next)
3. In your web browser, copy the URI for the repository:
- Click the 'Clone or Download' button on the GitHub page and copy the URI
4. Paste the URI in it's field, enter your username and password (this repo is currently private)
5. Click Next
