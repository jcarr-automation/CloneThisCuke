# CloneThisCuke

General-Purpose **Maven** project that was created using **Java 13**, leveraging the common **Cucumber** and **RestAssured** test frameworks.
 
This project is meant to be a "jumpstart" BDD/ATDD project for any test automation engagements that would need scripts for:
- Web Browser (Windows 10)
- REST API
- Native Windows
- SQL (MySQL, MSSQL)

There are drivers in the project that enable each of the above interfaces to be tested.

*Drivers yet to be implemented or tested:*
- Web Browser (Mac OS X, SauceLabs)
- Native Mac
- Native Mobile
- SQL (Oracle, Sybase, DB2)
