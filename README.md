# CloneThisCuke

General-Purpose Gherkin project that was created using Java 13, leveraging the common "Cucumber" and "RestAssured" test frameworks.
 
This project is meant to be a "jumpstart" BDD/ATDD project for any test automation engagements that would need scripts for:
- Web Browser
- REST API
- Native Windows
- SQL (MySQL, MSSQL)

There are drivers in the project that enable each of the above interfaces to be tested.

Drivers yet to be implemented or tested:
- Web Browser (SauceLabs)
- Native Mac
- Native Mobile
- SQL (Oracle, Sybase, DB2)
